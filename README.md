# Algorithmic Trading Strategies

After interning at a quant trading company, I became intrigued by the US stock market and how to profit from it. This curiosity led me to explore personal finance and investing. I recently wrote an article on why you should invest early and harness the power of compound interest. You can read it [here](https://khznote.notion.site/Invest-early-the-power-of-compound-interest-3b5a087607c2416fadf653e370ad3223).

With a background in computer science, I created this repository to develop and backtest algorithmic trading strategies using the market data from the past 2 years (720 days to be exact).

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:
- **Python 3**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- **yahoo_fin**: A library to fetch stock market data. You can install it using pip.

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install yahoo_fin
```

## Trailing Stop-Loss Algorithm

One of the strategies I developed is based on the [Trailing Stop-Loss](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/trailing-stop-loss.asp) technique. The details of the algorithm can be found in `Strategy/trailingStop.py`. I backtested this strategy using data from the past 720 days.

### Backtest Results

I tested the algorithm with a variety of US stocks, including diversified stocks, highly volatile stocks, and big tech stocks. The strategy has outperformed a simple buy-and-hold approach over the 2-year period. Below are some backtest results:

#### Backtest on Most Volatile Stocks
```
Backtest on most volatile stocks including 'TSLA', 'OVV', 'OPEN', 'QS', 'MP', 'NIO', 'HRI', 'RUN', 'COIN', 'PLTR', 'CLF', 'SHOP'
----------Summary----------
Original balance $100000.00
Total TS amount $128809.16 - Total TS profit percent 28.81%
Total HOLD amount $106521.39 - Total HOLD profit percent 6.52%
```
#### Backtest on Big Tech Stocks
```
Backtest with Big tech stocks 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'NVDA', 'NFLX', 'QQQ', 'SPY', 'TSLA'
----------Summary----------
Original balance $100000.00
Total TS amount $269225.14 - Total TS profit percent 169.23%
Total HOLD amount $217763.78 - Total HOLD profit percent 117.76%
```

### Analysis

The results indicate that the algorithm effectively maximizes profit and minimizes losses. For instance, when backtested with NVDA, the algorithm yielded a profit percent of **826.25%** compared to **551.89%** from a simple buy-and-hold strategy since the beginning at low price 2 years ago. This demonstrates that the algorithm outperforms most of the stock market and manages risk through its dynamic low threshold bar.
