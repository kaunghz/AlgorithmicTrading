    Trailing Stop based algorithm to outperform the market.
        Algorithm summary
        -----------------
    keep track of the minimum price
    if the current price hits 120% of the minimum price, the stock keeps likely going up --> BUY
    For BUY, set the initial low and high bar to sell (managing the risk)

    After BUY, we either HOLD them or SELL them
    if the price keeps going up, we keep updating the low and high bar
    if the price hits either low or high bar, we sell them

    @prices: list of stock prices from MarketData
    @returns:
    float: Final balance after performing the backtest.
